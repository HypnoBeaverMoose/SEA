Me? You mean me? Someone's interested in me? Finally, some recognition! Ooh! Haha! Yes!
I-I'm sorry, I let myself go there a little bit. My name is Professor Henri Becquerel! Yes, and I am one of the discoverers of radiation! Me! I even won the Nobel prize! Of course my damn students had to go and take all the honor for themselves! THOSE DAMN CURRIES! Oh!
Oh sorry my dear child, I let myself go again! Have this temper I need to manage yes. Now, where was I...
@Yes! I did! Me, ME! It was I who discovered radiation! But those students of mine, Marie and Pierre...they...also got the prize. And they got their last names known to everyone who studies physics or chemistry! It's not fair! NOT FAIR I TELL YOU! If it weren't for my death it would have been my name in the books! Yes me!
@Now that is a question I can not answer I'm afraid. But it must have something to do with radiation..hmm...spectral radiation maybe? Hmm, would have to do more research. Good thing I'm already dead! Hihi! I no longer have to worry about those rays penetrating my cells! No! 
@I studied the effects of radiation, how do you THINK I DIED!? I-I was a lost cause... to old... to... weak. My body died only a few weeks after winning the prize...I...I was too weak to even hold it. IT'S NOT FAIR! And Mr. and Mrs. Currie, oh they got a live for at least 30 years or so. 30 YEARS! And they were given ALL the credit! 
@Other ghosts? Oh, you mean those other paintings. Yes. Ehm, I don't know. That woman, she whispers things into my ears...at least...think she does...or was that my own voice I heard? 

And that man, the scary one, he-he freaks me out a little. Doesn't really understand much about the world, thinks all this talk about radiation is nonsense! Nonsense! Well if that would be the case I wouldn't have died now would I? No no, not at all, hihi.
